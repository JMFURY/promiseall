# promiseall

Trying out a content loading placeholder while fetches occur in a [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) fashion. 


This is a test repo for some things I'm trying:
React Hooks

Promises (deeper fluency)

Zeit's Micro framework (has `micro-cors` on it)

Using Sublime Merge for git client (I dig it so far)
